Creating a css grid layout to use as the basis for a Hugo Theme

I found a couple of good youtube videos and have integrated their logic to build this sample layout.  It has a cool menu and is responsive.

Index.html is the good one.  Cssgrid.html is not responsive (I did it first and just kept it)

I added google fonts, My Gravatar image and svg social media icons.
